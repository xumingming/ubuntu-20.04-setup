# perf is located at /usr/bin/perf
# It is a shell script which invokes the "actual" perf
# We might need to modify the perf script a little bit
# more specifically the variable named "full_version"
# change it with the name under /usr/lib/linux-tools/<the-name-we-want> 
apt install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic
